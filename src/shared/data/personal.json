        "I'm a software engineer who designs, builds and sometimes rescues applications. I like to participate and build well-structured applications in terms of architecture and code quality, delivering a good quality product in order to promote a good user experience.",
        "I usually develop applications in C# for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend, but my mind is open to development on other stacks. As the IT area is always changing I try to keep up with these changes and put into practice new concepts and standards shared with the developer community, learning new frameworks and libraries that can help me innovate and be updated.",
        "In my spare time I like to develop new ideas and personal applications, from the creation of the graphical interface to its final functionalities. Another of my hobbies is calisthenics and cooking."
