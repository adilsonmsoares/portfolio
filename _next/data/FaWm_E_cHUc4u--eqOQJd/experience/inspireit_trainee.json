Both projects had a combination of React with Redux for frontend and .NET Core 2.1 API, Onion Architecture, SQL and Dapper ORM for backend.","The first project was company's internal portal, which was created to computerize manual tasks performed daily or monthly by employees, but mainly by the human resources team.","The second one arose from a challenge made to interns about who would deliver a base project for access control, routes and attendance of employees with a database, architecture and some features done for the team that would continue it. I ended up accepting the challenge and delivering it as requested, with great satisfaction as the product is now being used by companies."]}],"visitButton":{"text":"View Inspire IT","url":"https://inspireit.pt/en/"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
